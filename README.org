** Stack Notes
- This project utilizes Vite (http://vitejs.dev) as it's dev server / build process. Vite offers lightning fast compilation and live reloading and has several advantages over harder-to-configure Webpack including compatiblity with Rollup plugins.
- For form state-management, this project utilizes the Formik (https://formik.org/) library along with Yup (https://github.com/jquense/yup) for input validation.
